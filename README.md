# 🎮 Slacken

*Slacken* is a small casual mobile game created for the **Voodoo competition**.  
The main goal of this project was not only to develop a **Voodoo-style mobile game**, but also to **experiment with time manipulation mechanics** — a concept I plan to explore further in future, more ambitious projects.

## 🕹️ Game Concept

In *Slacken*, you have the **ability to slow down time** for a short duration.  
However, when you return to the normal flow of time, **it speeds up** to compensate.  

The action takes place in a **battle arena**, where your only objective is simple yet challenging:  
**survive as long as you can.**
